Apple Pay allows you to use NFC capable devices to make payments. It brings together everything you need at checkout and keeps your payment info safe in your Apple Account until you're ready to pay.

Apple Pay is built into iPhone, Apple Watch, Mac, iPad, and Apple Vision Pro. 

To get started on iPhone, open the Wallet app and tap the plus symbol.

Then add a credit or debit card by tapping the back of your iPhone with your eligible card. [Apple Pay&trade;](https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/) 

You’ll have the option to add your card to your other devices at the same time. When you want to pay, just double-click, tap, and you’re set.
